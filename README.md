## 📌 RegExp Console-Based Input Validation Project

This is a simple yet practical Python console application that demonstrates how to use **regular expressions (RegEx)** to validate user input for commonly required personal details. The program ensures that the data entered conforms to specific formats, enhancing both usability and data integrity.

### 🔍 Features

- **Name Validation**: Ensures that only alphabetic characters and spaces are allowed.
- **Date of Birth Validation**: Accepts input in the format `dd-mm-yyyy` and converts it into `dd-mon-yyyy` using abbreviated month names.
- **Email ID Validation**: Restricts input to Gmail addresses following the format `example@gmail.com`.
- **Mobile Number Validation**: Validates numbers in the format `xxx-xxx-xxxx` and converts them into a continuous digit string.
- **Formatted Output**: After successful validation and conversion, it displays all the details in a clean and formatted manner.
